    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The art&nbsp;community consists of passionate individuals that create work they are not always thanked or compensated fairly for. From contract artists such as game illustrators and animators to independent freelance artists, the one thing they undoubtedly had in common was love for the craft. Unlike more revered fields such as medicine or law, most artists were not encouraged to pursue a creative career. And unlike most working-class jobs, artists are tied to their career by fondness and the feeling of dissatisfaction from pursuing any other path, even more secure or well-off ones. It could be argued that part of the inherent value in their work comes from time, experience, and passion; <em>so what if something were to create art that looked just like theirs, except without the time, experience, and passion?</em></p>
